## Technical Challenges of Scraping the "Impact" Tables
Extracting data from the GDACS (Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System) portal, specifically the "Impact" tables, presented several nuanced technical challenges. The primary obstacle stemmed from the dynamic and irregular structure of the web pages. GDACS provides comprehensive disaster data, but the format of this information can vary drastically between historical events (e.g., from 2020 or 2022) and more recent crises. 

One major challenge was locating and extracting nested metadata, such as the "INFORM Coping Capacity" and "Exposed Population" metrics. These data points are often embedded deep within asynchronous HTML tables or custom div classes that do not consistently share the same identifiers across all event reports. Consequently, the scraping logic required robust, conditional traversals of the DOM tree (often utilizing libraries like BeautifulSoup and regular expressions) to isolate the exact text elements.

Furthermore, the extracted text itself required significant cleaning. Population figures were represented inconsistently—sometimes formatted with commas (e.g., "11,000"), sometimes using text abbreviations (e.g., "860 thousand" or "2.5 million"), and other times combined with descriptive text ("About 17000 people in MMI"). To accurately compute indices and metrics, it was necessary to implement robust parsing functions that could translate these varied string representations into standardized, numeric floating-point values. Ensuring this data hygiene was critical; without it, downstream calculations—such as the "Forgotten Crisis" Index—would either fail or produce erroneous insights. Finally, dealing with network rate limits and ensuring the scraping scripts gracefully handled timeouts (using sleep intervals and retry logic) was essential to building a resilient data pipeline.

## The Evolution of Disaster Response and Media Coverage
By analyzing the extracted GDACS dataset through our custom indices, we can observe distinct patterns concerning the evolution of global disaster response and media attention. A key question is whether the world is responding faster today and whether media focus aligns accurately with regions of the highest vulnerability.

Our analysis of the dual-timeline (overlaying news volume growth) indicates a clear acceleration in the velocity of reporting. Recent events, such as the earthquakes in the Philippines and Afghanistan in 2025, demonstrated a highly rapid spike in media coverage within the first 24 to 48 hours. The sheer volume of peak news articles generated for recent disasters is significantly higher than historical comparable events, suggesting that the digital media ecosystem is indeed responding faster and disseminating information more broadly today than in the past.

However, when examining whether media focus aligns with the areas of highest vulnerability, a stark misalignment emerges. To analyze this, we developed the **"Forgotten Crisis" Index**, which calculates a ratio of total news volume to the exposed population. Our findings reveal that media coverage is often disproportionate to the actual human impact and systemic vulnerability. 

For instance, comparing the recent Philippines and Afghanistan events highlighted a paradox. The Philippines earthquake (M 6.9) exposed a massive population, yet when we look at the raw news articles generated per affected individual, the coverage was heavily diluted. Conversely, the Afghanistan earthquake (M 6.3) impacted a less populous area but struck a region with a severely higher vulnerability score (worse INFORM Coping Capacity). The Afghanistan event triggered a Red Alert and generated a proportionately larger media response relative to the number of people affected.

This tells us that while the absolute speed of the world's media response is increasing globally, media focus acts somewhat erratically—sometimes prioritizing geopolitical context, secondary impacts, or sudden high-severity alerts over the raw number of exposed individuals. Ultimately, while the world is arguably "faster" to report crises today, the media ecosystem remains imperfectly aligned with objective, holistic measures of ground-level vulnerability.
